            <p> What makes Zen Garden so interesting is how it shows what can be accomplished with CSS. It represents how with creativity and skill you are able to display the information on a website in a wide variaty of ways. It also shows how HTML makes up the structure of the website, the design can be changed but the website itself is really the same.</p>

            <p> My favorite design was Mid Century Modern for how it used color and divided up the information on the webpage. The layout is divided into multiple sections and within those section there are articles, with all these divisions the author is able have a colored background behind the text and behind that background is a background image.</p>
